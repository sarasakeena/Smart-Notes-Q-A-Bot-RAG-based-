# Notes-Q-A-Bot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot built using LangChain and Mistral AI. It allows users to upload their notes and ask questions directly from the content of those notes, ensuring that answers are accurate, context-aware, and grounded in the provided material.
